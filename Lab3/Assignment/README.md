# Assignment 1
Create a new project to implement the code in Home Assignment 1.
Initialize for i and j variable. Compile and upload to the simulator.
Run this program step by step, observe the changing of memory and the content of registers at each step.
# Assignment 2
Create a new project implementing the code in Home Assignment 2.
Initialize for i, n, step, sum variables and array A.
Compile and upload to the simulator.
Run this program step by step, observe the changing of memory and the content of registers by each step.
Try to test with some more cases (change the value of variables)
# Assignment 3
Create a new project implementing the code in Home Assignment 3.
Compile and upload to the simulator.
Run this program step by step, observe the changing of memory and the content of registers by each step.
Change the value of test variable and run this program some times to check all cases.
# Assignment 4
Modify the Assignment 1, so that the condition tested is
- i < j
- i \>= j
- i+j <= 0
- i+j > m+n
# Assignment 5
Modify the Assignment 2, so that the condition tested at the end of the loop is
- i < n
- i <= n
- sum >= 0
- A[i] == 0
# Assignment 6
Using all of above instructions and statements, create a new project to implement this function:
Find the element with the largest absolute value in a list of integers.
Assuming that this list is store in an integer array and we know the number of elements in it.
